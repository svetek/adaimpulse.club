        <h3>Cardano ADA Staking: How to easily stake for the best Crypto return</h3>
        <h4>What is Staking?</h4>
        <p>
          Staking is the mechanism for how you get rewarded for participating in securing a proof-of-stake (PoS)
          Cryptocurrency blockchain. It is similar to mining in a proof-of-work (PoW) system like Bitcoin, but without
          the requirement to have powerful hardware in order to solve complex mathematical equations to be eligible to
          produce the next block on the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          A proof of stake system has a consensus algorithm that selects which node (stake pool server) will be eligible
          to add the next block to the blockchain. This decision is based on a number of criteria, but the main one
          being the total amount of coin that has been delegated to that pool. When someone delegates to a stake pool,
          that person is increasing that pool's chances of producing blocks. When a pool produces a block the system
          pays out a reward (from its reserves) which is the incentive mechanism to encourage people to run reliable
          nodes to produce and verify transactions on the blockchain. These rewards are then split between the stake
          pool operator and the delegators based on the amount that has been delegated (minus the fees to run the stake
          pool).
        </p>
        <p>
          For a Cardano (ADA) delegator, the important thing to remember is that your ADA never leaves your own wallet.
          It is almost like you are tearing off a ticket stub (but keeping the important ticket) and putting this into a
          syndicate lottery draw to try and win the lottery. If you win, you share the rewards with your syndicate group
          (stake pool). You don't send anyone your ADA and no one can access your ADA without your private keys. The
          only thing you do need to do is submit a separate delegation transaction onto the blockchain, which is like a
          signup sheet to say which syndicate group your ticket stub is assigned to. We will show you how to do this
          simple process below.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Why Stake?</h4>
        <p>
          The biggest benefit is that you get a passive return of roughly 4%-6% (per year) on your ADA. You can start
          receiving ADA payouts every five days once your delegation becomes active. You are also free to keep using or
          spending your ADA as you see fit. There are no lock up periods like other Cryptocurrencies and you can even
          delegate from a hardware wallet. Once you have delegated your wallet, your rewards and any new ADA you add to
          your wallet, get automatically delegated. The other benefit is by delegating your stake to a smaller pool it
          helps with a more diverse and decentralised network and contributes to a more secure Cardano system.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        <h4>The Delegation Cycle</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: red;">For any change in delegation, the rewards are reflected after 3 epoch transitions
            (thus, after 15-20 days). Checkout details below for how it works:</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            An Epoch in cardano is 5 days long. Any change in Delegation is captured in snapshot at end of the epoch (at
            1st epoch transition).
          </li>
          <li>
            The snapshot captured is considered live at the next (2nd) epoch transition. This means the pool you
            delegated to would reflect your delegation in n+2 epochs, to qualify for chance to make blocks proportional
            to its stake (which would now include your delegation).
          </li>
          <li>
            The blocks made by pool qualifies for rewards, which is calculated at next epoch transition (thus,
            calculation occurs at n+3).
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, The rewards are then paid out at the end of next epoch n+3. Thus, if you delegated in epoch n your
            rewards will be with you by the start of epoch n+4 (technically, it will be at the end of epoch n+3). The
            visual representation of the above explaination is as per below (using n=213 in the example):
          </li>

          <h4>How to stake Cardano (ADA)</h4>
          <p>
            There are a few different ways of staking ADA on Cardano. The preferred method is when you set up and own
            your own wallet, securing your own keys, and delegating using one of Cardano's recommended wallets. The
            hardest part of this method is that you need to write down and secure the 15 random words that get generated
            when you first create a wallet. These are known as your private keys.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other less preferred option is leaving your ADA on an exchange and staking through the exchange. While
            it may be convenient, there are a few big downsides with leaving your ADA on an exchange. Firstly you might
            have heard "not your keys, not your coins". This means that unless you are the only person who has your keys
            (your 15 random words), you don't truly own or control your cryptocurrency. A ridiculous amount of exchanges
            have been hacked, had funds stolen, or just plain disappeared with millions of cryptocurrency taken. You
            also might encounter exchange withdrawals or deposits being locked at times you really want to access your
            crypto. You also can't participate in voting on key decisions that will impact the future of the
            cryptocurrency ecosystem. Finally, you contribute to the problem of large centralised players having too
            much staking and voting rights in what should be a decentralised system. This is especially important in a
            proof of stake system where you don't want one person or group controlling a large portion of the
            cryptocurrency.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not staking as such, the other option of making a return is lending via a decentralised finance (DeFi)
            or centralised finance (CeFi) platform. This normally means transferring your cryptocurrency into the hands
            of a custodian who holds it for the purposes of lending to others. You then get a return but it also comes
            with much higher risk so it won't be covered here.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h4>Staking ADA using a Cardano Wallet</h4>
          <p>
            The two main recommended wallets are Yoroi, a lightweight browser extension or mobile app, and Daedalus, a
            full node wallet for desktops that downloads the whole blockchain and is more suitable for advanced users.
            In this guide, we will cover Yoroi which is an easy to set up beginner option.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong id="blog-post-str">Step 1:</strong> Download the wallet directly from the <strong><a
                href="https://yoroi-wallet.com" target="_blank" title="Yoroi wallet">official Yoroi website</a></strong>
            (going directly to the website helps to avoid the numerous fake wallets that are around). Depending what
            platform you are using (Android vs iPhone vs Browser) it will redirect you to the appropriate store to
            download directly.

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong id="blog-post-str">Step 2:</strong> If you are doing the install on the browser, you will need to
            now open the newly installed Yoroi extension. You should find this in the top right hand corner of your
            browser with an icon as follows

          </p>
          <p>
            Select your language, read and accept the terms of use, and allow Cardano Payment URLs, following up by
            clicking <strong>Allow</strong> on the pop-up, then <strong>Finish</strong>.

            <img src="img/yoroi/yoroi03.png" width="60%">
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong id="blog-post-str">Step 3:</strong> Create your wallet
          </p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Assuming you don't already have a hardware wallet (like a Ledger Nano device), select the <strong>Create
                Wallet</strong> option. Ordering a hardware wallet is a good idea if you have a sizeable amount you want
              to protect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now select <strong>Cardano</strong> when you are offered the option to <strong>Pick a currency or
                platform</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select <strong>Create Wallet</strong>, giving your wallet a memorable name (<strong>Petty Cash</strong> or
              <strong>Main Bank</strong> for example), and then set a hard to guess spending password (using your
              password manager - you use a password manager right? No? We’ll cover that another day).
            </li>
            <li>
              Read the guidelines for the recovery phrase. <strong>This is a very important step</strong>. These 15
              random words give anyone the ability to recreate your wallet and spend from it. They don't even need your
              spending password. Once you have read the below, you can tick the box and click <strong>Continue</strong>.

              Don't take a photo of these words.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write the words down the old fashioned way, on pen and paper.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make a backup of these words and store them at another location.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write down the recovery phrase on paper. Click <strong>Yes, I've written it down</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              Test what you have written down by inputting your recovery phrase.
            </li>
            <li>
              Read the next two warnings, tick the boxes and click <strong>Confirm</strong>.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Dashboard</strong> gives you your overview of total ADA and rewards along with what rewards are
              upcoming.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transactions</strong> give you all your wallet transactions, with status, fees, amount and the
              date and type.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Send</strong> is where you can send your funds. Always triple check the receiver address and if
              sending large amounts start with a small test amount to make sure you have the right address. You
              <strong>never</strong> use this screen when you delegate to a stake pool.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Receive</strong> is where you generate your receive addresses and is the first screen you should
              be using to receive your ADA from the exchange or place where you purchased it. You always get a fresh
              address once an address has received ADA.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Voting</strong> relates to Project Catalyst and gives you the ability to vote on community
              proposals and projects. A very cool feature that gives you a say in the ongoing development of the
              ecosystem.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Delegation list</strong> is where you can search and select the stake pool that you want to

          </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong id="blog-post-str">Step 5:</strong> Transfer your ADA into your wallet by generating a receive
            address and copying this into the withdrawal screen of your exchange. You can send a small test amount if

              On the <strong>Delegation</strong> screen search for your chosen stake pool by entering their ticker. For
